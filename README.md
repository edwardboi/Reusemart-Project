Technologies Used: Flutter (Mobile) | ReactJS (Web) | Laravel (Backend) | MySQL (Database)

ReuseMart is a resale platform for pre-owned items that operates under a consignment-based system. Instead of selling directly, individuals entrust their second-hand goods to ReuseMart's centralized warehouse, where the items are managed and sold on their behalf. The platform aims to encourage eco-conscious consumption by enabling the circulation of used products and contributing to broader social responsibility initiatives.

The platform is designed to support multiple user roles, each with distinct functionalities tailored to their responsibilities. These roles include: Customer, Organization, Custodian, Warehouse Staff, Customer Service (CS), Couriers, Hunters, Admin, and Owner.
